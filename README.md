🎯 Problem Statement
In most campuses, communication between students and administration remains outdated and inefficient:

Students miss event notifications or have no proper channel to raise concerns.
Organizers struggle with reaching the right audience for campus activities.
Authorities receive scattered complaints with no real-time tracking or prioritization.
Campus Unite addresses all these pain points by providing a single web interface where every user has a clear, role-based experience.
